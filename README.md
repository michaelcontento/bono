# [Bono][]

This is my personal (and first) 2D engine / module library for [Monkey][] -
a "cross translator" that translates into html5, objective-c, c++ and even
flash.

## Getting started

### Installation?

Just clone this project to some path that monkey is actual using for source
lookups. This is usually something like `.` and `$MONKEY_DIR/modules`. So feel
free to install it system wide for all monkey projects with:

    $ cd $MONKEY_DIR
    $ git clone git://github.com/michaelcontento/bono.git modules/bono

But this is something I would __not__ recommend! Because if your usign a proper
SCM for your project (if not: do it. right. now.), you can track the used bono
version. This allows you to handle multiple projects with different versions
of bono and it's easy to build a project again even after months of inactivity
(because you know which bono version to use).

__TL;DR__ Do something like this:

    $ cd $PROJECT_DIR
    $ git submodule add git://github.com/michaelcontento/bono.git
    $ git submodule update --init

### How to start?

Use this short example as a starting point:

```monkey
Import bono
Import mojo

Class MyApp Extends bono.App
    Method Run:Void()
        GetDirector().AddScene("menu", New MenuScene())
        GetDirector().GotoScene("menu")
    End
End

Class MenuScene Extends Scene
    Method OnRender:Void()
        DrawText("Hello World", 100, 100)
    End
End

Function Main:Int()
    New MyApp()
    Return 0
End
```

And please visit `src/kernel/` as this "sub-module" contains all the core stuff
like how the different events (`OnRender`, `OnUpdate`, `OnTouchDown` etc.) are
dispatched. You need to understand a few principles and everything else should
be rather simple :)

## Documentation?

Jesus. Read the code!

No, just kidding. I try my best to put a `README.md` with some instructions
right beside the code. So just browse the `src/` directory and Github should
render some nice docs below the folder listing. If not? Well .. that's a sign
that I haven't wrote anything yet. Read the code and I'd love to accept a PR
with improved docs ;)

## Games built with Bono

* All [CoRa Games][] games - [Full listing of all games][cr-1]
* Drag-Math: Multiplication on [Google Play][dm-1], [Amazon][dm-2]

## Tests

All tests are stored in `tests/` and can be executed with:

    $ make tests

But there are other make targets that are quite usefull:

* __lint__: run [pep8][] for all python files
* __imports__: update the master import file `bono.monkey`
* __dependencies__: install all required python dependencies
* __clean__: remove all build artefacts and other temporary stuff

## Contribute

1. Fork this project
1. Make your changes (new features, bufixes, examples, ...)
1. Write tests for it
1. Be sure that _all tests_ are still green
1. Send me a pull request

Too complicated? You just wanna mess around for yourself? Thats fine! Just skip
everything after step two :)
